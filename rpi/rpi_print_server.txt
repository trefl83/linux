# step by step instructions on how to setup rpi print servier with hp laser jet p1006

1. prepare sd card with rasbian lite (debian 11.2)
2. sudo raspi-config to set-up keyboard localization
3. sudo raspi-config to set-up wifi connection
4. sudo raspi-config to enable waiting for network on boot
5. sudo raspi-config to enable ssh access
6. configure router to assing static ip address
7. sudo apt install cups
8. allow pi user to use the printer 'sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin pi'
9. configure CUPS so that it is accessible across the network 'sudo cupsctl --remote-any'
10. don't try to install printer-driver-foo2zjs from repo - it won't work (I think some usb hot-plug related issues may exist, as enabling hot-plug using the alternative method started the printer)
11. clone https://github.com/koenkooi/foo2zjs and install accoring to INSTALL instructions
12. no need to run ./getweb P1006
13. add printer in cups https://192.168.0.100:631/ using this https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-print-server
14. add network printer in windows, but not using automatic detection(!), but manually by providing url from cups (http, not https) e.g. http://192.168.0.100:631/printers/HP_LaserJet_P1006
15. print :)
